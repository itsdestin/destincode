// is the hook that runs once per RUN, before any worker and after nothing else.
// Named by vitest.config.ts (pid-suffixed, one per run) and handed over in the
// real process env rather than re-derived here — this hook runs in the SAME
// process that evaluated the config, so it can simply read what that decided.
// The fallback only fires if someone runs this hook outside vitest.
