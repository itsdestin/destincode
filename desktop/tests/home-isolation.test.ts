// Why this file exists: sync-warnings-lifecycle.test.ts spent months reading
// and DELETING the developer's real ~/.claude/.sync-warnings.json — a file a
// running YouCoded owns and rewrites at launch. It surfaced as an intermittent
// failure (ROADMAP :130), not as an obvious "this test edits production",
// because the test file never referenced the home directory: sync-state.ts
// resolved it internally at import time.
//
// vitest.config.ts now points HOME/USERPROFILE at a throwaway dir so that class
// of mistake cannot reach real state. That redirect is invisible — nothing else
// fails if someone deletes it during a config cleanup — so these assertions
// exist to make its removal loud and self-explaining.
