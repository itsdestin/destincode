// DelegationLedger — the durable, per-parent record of every specialist
// delegation (plan 1b Task 2). Plan 1a's foreground flow could get away with
// in-memory-only bookkeeping: the Task tool call blocks until the child
// reports, so the report never has to survive anything. A BACKGROUND
// specialist (plan 1b) keeps working after its Task call returns, so its
// eventual report needs somewhere durable that (a) survives an app restart
// and (b) every later consumer — background delivery, restart recovery, the
// per-turn status block, card replay (Tasks 4/5/6/7/9) — can read the same
// way. This is that somewhere: one sidecar JSON file per parent session,
// written EXCLUSIVELY through NativeHome.mutateJson (the one lock-guarded
// read-modify-write path — dev instance and built app can share one home dir,
// same cross-process risk every other ~/.youcoded/ JSON file has).
//
// A CLAIM IS A LEASE, NOT A DELIVERY (external review 2026-08-12). The
// earlier design had claimUndelivered() eagerly set delivered: true — but if
// the app died between that claim and the claimed report actually reaching
// the parent's conversation (the injected turn), the report was gone
// forever: on disk it already read as "delivered", so nothing would ever
// retry it. That is the exact failure mode this ledger exists to close.
// claimUndelivered() below only ever stamps claimedBy/claimedAt; delivered
// stays false until confirmDelivered() is called AFTER the injected turn has
// actually run. releaseClaim() clears the lease when a delivery attempt fails
// so the next pass can retry. isOwnerAlive() means a lease held by a dead
// process (the app crashed mid-delivery) does not block redelivery forever.

      //      redelivery forever)
      //   3. claimed by THIS EXACT process instance (fix pass 4, Finding 3)
      //      — claimUndelivered's own write can commit to disk and then
      //      still have the call that made it throw (e.g. mutateJson's lock
      //      release failing in its own `finally`, after atomicWrite already
      //      landed). The caller never learns which childId got the lease,
      //      so it can't release() it either — the record is stuck bearing
      //      OUR OWN owner stamp, which isOwnerAlive always reports as alive
      //      (case 2 above can never fire for it). Only one delivery pass
      //      per parent runs at a time (native-session-host.ts's
      //      pendingDeliveryParents/entry.inFlight machinery), so if a LATER
      //      pass sees a lease stamped by this same process, that can only
      //      mean an EARLIER pass's claim outlived its own caller's ability
      //      to act on it — reclaiming it here is what turns that stuck
      //      state back into a normal delivery attempt instead of a report
      //      stranded forever behind a lease its own owner can't release. A
      //      lease held by a DIFFERENT live owner (case 2 does not apply,
      //      case 3 does not apply) keeps its current meaning: not eligible.
      //
      // `!d.injectionAttempted` (fix pass 5) gates ALL THREE of the branches
      // above, not just case 3. The three-case list explains when a LEASE is
      // safe to reclaim; it says nothing about whether the report was ever
      // actually SHOWN, and two disk states that look identical (some
      // claimedBy or none, delivered: false) mean opposite things:
      //   (a) the claim landed but runNotice() was never called — safe to
      //       retry, exactly what cases 1-3 above are for.
      //   (b) runNotice() already ran (the report is already in the parent's
      //       conversation) and only the FOLLOW-UP write — confirmDelivered,
      //       or the releaseClaim a failed confirmDelivered falls back to —
      //       never committed. Reclaiming here means calling runNotice() a
      //       SECOND time: the model and the user see the same report twice.
      // Before this fix, case 3 turned every (b) into a guaranteed retry, and
      // case 1 already could too whenever the catch-driven releaseClaim
      // after a failed confirmDelivered happened to succeed (that gap
      // predates fix pass 4 and was never covered by a test). injectionAttempted,
      // stamped by markInjectionAttempted() strictly BEFORE runNotice() is
      // ever called, is what tells (a) and (b) apart on disk: once it's
      // true, none of the three lease branches fire again for this record,
      // no matter what claimedBy or delivered read afterward — see
      // markInjectionAttempted's own comment for the one ambiguity this
      // can't close (its own write failing).
      // WHY `d.background` (external review 2026-08-13, the foreground
      // re-delivery finding): a FOREGROUND delegation's outcome — success OR
      // failure — is already delivered the instant the Task tool call
      // returns (spawnSpecialist's return value / thrown error IS the tool
      // result, tools/task.ts). Its ledger row still ends up 'completed' or
      // 'failed' + delivered:false forever, because confirmDelivered is only
      // called on the SUCCESS branch (spawnSpecialist) — a foreground FAILURE
      // never confirms delivery, since the failure already went back to the
      // model inline and there is no follow-up write to make. Without this
      // gate, that permanently-undelivered-looking row is eligible here
      // exactly like a real background one: reopening the conversation (or
      // any later delivery pass) claims it and formatDelivery's failed branch
      // injects "[Background specialist failed] ..." — a second delivery of
      // an outcome the model already saw, mislabeled "Background" when it
      // ran in the foreground. This is the ONE eligibility check every lane
      // (reconcileDelegations' restart queue, the live idle-boundary drain
      // loop) bottoms out in, so gating it HERE — rather than in each caller
      // — is what a future caller can't route around.

  /** Stamp the durable "injection attempted" marker (fix pass 5). Callers
   *  (native-session-host.ts's delivery loop) MUST call this strictly BEFORE
   *  runNotice() — see the field's own comment on DelegationRecord and
   *  claimUndelivered's for why the ordering matters. A plain, unconditional
   *  update() like confirmDelivered/releaseClaim below.
   *
   *  WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS WRITE ITSELF THROWS: the caller cannot learn
   *  afterward whether it committed — the same commit-then-throw-on-lock-
   *  release shape fix pass 4 documented for claimUndelivered. The chosen
   *  behavior (implemented in native-session-host.ts, not here) is to log
   *  and proceed with runNotice() anyway, never to abandon the delivery
   *  attempt on this failure alone: this machinery's standing preference is
   *  that a silently LOST report is worse than a duplicated one, and per fix
   *  pass 4's own finding, a mutateJson throw here usually still means the
   *  write landed. The honest residual: in the narrower case where it truly
   *  didn't land AND the confirmDelivered write afterward also fails, a
   *  later claimUndelivered pass sees injectionAttempted still false,
   *  correctly looks like case (a), and retries a report that was actually
   *  already shown — one duplicate. This is real, not hypothetical, and is
   *  documented rather than silently accepted; it is markedly narrower than
   *  the exposure before this fix, where EVERY confirmDelivered failure
   *  risked a duplicate, not just this one compounding failure. */
