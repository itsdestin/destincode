// Holds ownership handoffs for windows that cannot receive them yet.
//
// WHY this exists (2026-09-03): a session tear-off hands the session to a
// BrowserWindow created one statement earlier. `webContents.send` at that moment
// reaches a renderer whose React tree does not exist, and Electron DROPS a
// message with no listener rather than queueing it — measured on 41.10.7:
// a send issued right after `new BrowserWindow()` never reaches a listener
// registered 1.5 s later. So every tear-off into a fresh window silently
// skipped its entire handoff: no history hydration (the conversation rendered
// frozen at the moment the session was resumed), no "open on the session you
// just dragged", no re-send of an open permission ask.
//
// The window therefore PULLS once mounted (IPC.DETACH_CLAIM_PENDING) instead of
// being pushed at before it can listen — the same shape already used for the
// buddy overlay's boot geometry. `ready` is what keeps the two paths exclusive:
// before a window has pulled, transfers queue; after, they push. A payload is
// delivered exactly once either way, never twice and never zero times.
//
// Ids are `webContents.id` values throughout — see windowFromWcId's WHY in
// main.ts for why BrowserWindow.id is the wrong key everywhere in this app.
