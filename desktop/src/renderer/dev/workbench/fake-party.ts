// fake-party.ts — Task 7c. Workbench-only stand-in for the PartyKit Connect
// Four room (partykit/src/connect-four-room.ts), so the game is playable in a
// browser tab with no socket, no server, and no Destin-facing network call.
//
// WHY this exists: the real client (party-client.ts) wraps `partysocket`,
// which tries to open a real WebSocket to youcoded-games.itsdestin.partykit.dev.
// The workbench never opens sockets (see dev-workbench design spec §2), so the
// panel sat on "Connecting…" forever. This file speaks the SAME wire protocol
// the real room does — `{type:'player-joined', username}` and
// `{type:'move', username, column}` — so the real client code in
// usePartyGame.ts (dropPiece/checkWin/checkDraw from ../../game/connect-four)
// runs completely unmodified against a fake opponent, "Jake".
//
// Two layers:
//   1. FakeConnectFourServer — tracks the board, decides Jake's replies. Pure
//      logic, no socket shape, easy to unit test directly.
//   2. FakePartySocket — the thing actually injected in place of `PartySocket`
//      via party-client.ts's __setPartySocketFactory (see install-mock.ts).
//      Implements just the subset of the PartySocket surface party-client.ts
//      touches: addEventListener/removeEventListener, send, close, readyState.
