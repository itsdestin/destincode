// what these scenarios exist to show off, so a scenario that left them off
// would render an almost-empty bar and prove nothing. This is every WidgetId
// StatusBar.tsx defines — the defaultVisible:true ones so the bar looks like
// a normally-configured one, plus every opt-in one (In/Out/Cached/Reuse,
// Session Cost, Code Changes, Session Duration, Active Ratio, Output Speed).
// Session Duration and Active Ratio are included on the NATIVE scenarios too
// on purpose: their own render gate (StatusBar.tsx — `ss?.duration != null`)
// hides them for native regardless of this setting, since a native session
// carries no `sessionStats`. Leaving them ON here is what makes that contrast
// (CC has the chip; native's Customize menu explains why it can't) visible
// side by side instead of looking like an oversight in one scenario's setup.
//
// The key is StatusBar.tsx's own STORAGE_KEY (not exported — hardcoded here,

/** Assigns the mock bridge. No-op when a real bridge is already present —

/** The workbench renders the DESKTOP app, so it must say so.
 *
 *  platform-bootstrap.ts decides the platform from `window.claude` at
 *  module-graph head and mirrors it onto `<html data-platform>` synchronously,
 *  "so it lands before any style evaluates". The workbench installs its mock in
 *  index.tsx's boot branch — after every import has evaluated — so that check
 *  sees no bridge, leaves `__PLATFORM__` unset, and never writes the attribute.
 *
 *  The consequence is not subtle: EVERY `html[data-platform="electron"]` rule
 *  in globals.css silently does nothing. That includes both halves of the
 *  terminal bottom-frame fix (PR #196), so terminal view rendered without its
 *  bottom frame strip and looked exactly like a bug that had already been fixed
 *  in the app. A workbench that mis-renders real CSS is worse than no
 *  workbench — it sends you hunting for bugs that are not there.
 *
 *  Setting it here is enough for CSS because the attribute is only read by
 *  selectors, and this runs before `createRoot().render()`. Module-level consts
 *  that captured `isAndroid()` at import time already fall back to 'electron'
 *  (platform.ts), which is the answer we want anyway. */
