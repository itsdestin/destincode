// The "What is this?" content behind the (i) on Settings → Permissions.
//
// Layman's terms on purpose — this doubles as in-app help (see the
// SettingsExplainer module header). No tool ids, no rule syntax, nothing a
// non-developer would have to look up.
//
// WHY this is data rather than markup: SettingsExplainer owns every bit of the
// rendering, so the copy can be reviewed (and later translated) without reading
// a component. It also keeps SettingsPanel.tsx, already 2,600+ lines, from
// growing another screen of prose.
//
// THIS FILE IS WHERE THE EXPLANATION LIVES. The Permissions body is reference
// and data — three one-line mode definitions, the short list of what the app
// never waves through, and the approvals themselves. It carries NO mode control:
// mode is per-conversation state set from the status-bar chip in the chat, so a
// control on that screen would set nothing (PermissionsSection.tsx, MODES).
// Everything that used to be a paragraph on that screen was folded in here (the
// mode caption, the always-asks framing, how far an approval reaches), and the
// paragraph the body used to print about Claude Code was deleted outright
// because this file already had it. Length is fine here; a reader opened the (i)
// on purpose.
//
// The intro deliberately does NOT restate what the list itself says. The
// section's own first line already tells the user what the entries ARE and what
// removing one does; this tells them where the entries come from and points at
// the settings that decide how often they get asked in the first place.

    // The second paragraph is the caption that used to sit under the mode
    // control on the screen itself. It says "each conversation" and "change it
    // at any time" and nothing about a saved default, because there is no
    // persisted default-mode setting — the mode belongs to the conversation.

    // The third sentence is the honest caveat. The old on-screen line said "This
    // part cannot be turned off", which is not what the engine does: these are
    // `ask` entries, not `deny` ones, and remembered approvals are the LAST
    // layer applied (native-session-host.ts:291-301), so an explicit "Always
    // allow" on one of them wins from then on. The app makes that deliberately
    // hard — a deny-listed ask puts a second confirm in front of the "Always
    // allow" button (ToolCard.tsx PermissionButtons) — but it is possible, and
    // the result is visible and removable on the screen this explains.
