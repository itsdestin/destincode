// The end of a solo run (Destin, 2026-08-31: "single-player/high-score games
// should have a clear end/failure screen with a retry button").
//
// WHY THIS IS SHARED AND NOT PER-GAME: Flappy and 2048 had each grown their own
// end overlay, and they had already drifted — Flappy celebrated a new best,
// 2048 silently did not, so the same achievement was worth a badge in one game
// and nothing in the other. G-1 (one primitive, one look) exists for exactly
// this. Every solo game added later gets the same ending for free, and the
// answer to "what happens when you lose" stops being per-game folklore.
//
// The card is deliberately about the SCORE, not the failure. "No moves left" is
// a subtitle; the number you got is the headline, because that is the thing a
// high-score game is asking you to beat.
