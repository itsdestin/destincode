/* ── The value ramp (§5.2) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A tile's fill walks from the board's own neutral surface toward the theme's
 * accent as its number climbs, so the board visibly "heats up" as you play.
 *
 * THE TRAP, and why these numbers are not copied from `sheet-theme.ts`: that
 * file's five constants all mix toward a literal `#ffffff`, deliberately — a
 * spreadsheet's paper stays white in every theme, like Excel. A board built the
 * same way is white-on-white in every dark theme. So the TECHNIQUE transfers
 * (color-mix, stepped percentages) and the ENDPOINTS do not: both ends here are
 * theme tokens (`--inset` → `--accent`), which means the ramp inverts itself in
 * a dark theme instead of blowing out.
 *
 * Adjacent steps are ~9% apart, which is deliberately gentle: the NUMBER on the
 * tile is the information and the colour is reinforcement, so the ramp only has
 * to read as a gradient across the board, not as eleven nameable colours.
 *
 * The text colour flips at the halfway point. Below 50% the fill is nearer the
 * neutral surface, where `--fg` is the theme's own guaranteed-legible text;
 * at or above 50% it is nearer the accent, where `--on-accent` is (the theme
 * validator computes `--on-accent` to be legible against `--accent`). The
 * worst case for both is exactly at the switch, and that midpoint was measured
 * in all four built-in themes — see the note at the bottom of this file. */
