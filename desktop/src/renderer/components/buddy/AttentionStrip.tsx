  // Fix (M10, whole-branch review 2026-08-16): this component used to carry its
  // OWN colour table, which had drifted from every other dot in the app — it
  // painted 'stuck' RED (the rule reserves red for "definitely needs your
  // attention"; amber is "may be wrong, I don't know"), 'session-died' grey and
  // 'error' blue, and the new 'stalled' state fell through to that same blue
  // even though a parked turn is the clearest "act now" state there is.
  // Deferring to attentionDotColor() — the function the sidebar dots and the
  // attention reporter already use — removes the duplicate table rather than
  // adding a fifth entry to it, so the strip can never disagree again.
  // Consequence, stated so it is traceable: stalled blue→red, session-died
  // grey→red, error blue→red, stuck red→amber. awaitingApproval keeps its own
  // amber branch, unchanged.
