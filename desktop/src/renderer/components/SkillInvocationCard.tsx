/**
 * A user-invoked skill (/skill-name) in the timeline.
 *
 * WHY this exists rather than a user bubble full of text: /skill-name loads a
 * skill's instructions into the conversation, and those run to tens of thousands
 * of characters — theme-builder's SKILL.md is ~26,000. Sending them through the
 * normal user-message path rendered the entire file as one chat bubble
 * (Destin, 2026-07-28). The timeline should show what the user DID.
 *
 * It IS still a bubble, though. The first attempt gave this a dashed border and
 * no background, copying the compact Skill card the assistant side uses — but
 * that card gets its surface from the assistant bubble it sits inside. Standing
 * alone on the canvas it rendered transparent, floating on the wallpaper with
 * nothing tying it to the conversation (Destin: "why was the user message bubble
 * clear?"). So: same right-aligned bubble geometry as a user message, and the
 * same `in-view` + `bg-inset` pairing ThinkingIndicator uses, which is what opts
 * a non-user-bubble chat row into wallpaper-driven glassmorphism (the theme
 * engine targets `.in-view .bg-inset` descendants).
 *
 * Quieter than a real user bubble on purpose — bg-inset rather than bg-accent —
 * because the user typed one short command, not this content.
 *
 * The skill NAME itself is the link to its SKILL.md — FilepathToken's 'inline'
 * variant, dotted-underlined. A separate file chip beside it was just repeating
 * the same thing twice (Destin, 2026-07-28), and the name is already the most
 * natural thing to click. Same resolve-and-open behavior as any file pill in
 * chat, so the instructions stay one click away instead of flooding the
 * conversation.
